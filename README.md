## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-Got fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value at
one point and couldn't get fix it and had to start project over
-had trouble figuring out how to transfer data over from one view controller
to the next view controller bc of the String to Double conversion from the user
input to the tip and total amounts.
